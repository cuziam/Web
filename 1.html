    <p>Age of early Greek architecture: BC 1200s, The Dorian tribe clashed with the Mycenaean and won the war.
    because Doria was Iron Age civilization, but mycenae is Bronze Age civilization.</p>
    <p>BC 1000s, The Ionian tribe began to join the Dorian. At this time, Greek World was formed.
    After about 200 years, The Dorians and Ionian tribe were fully integrated.</p>
    <p>  Generally, the period of Greek Architecture is divided into the dark period (from BC1100s to BC 700s), the archaic period (from BC 700s to BC 480s), and the classical period (from BC480s to BC 323).
    The disposition of the Ionian was soft & sensitive but that of the Dorian was the other way hard & rational.</p>
